A PM handling system for the dialysis department at 
Lund University Hospital.

It is built around the JBoss ESB.

It maps the current work model of the department 
which unfortunately utilises MS Word documents.

1. Word documents are edited
2. Then mailed in (currently to the dept. secretary)
3. Which publishes PDFs onto a shared fileserver directory
4. Document expiratio dates are taken into account
4a. When expiration is close a notification mai is sent
4b. When document expires notification mai is sent

Notification mails have the expiring document attached.
